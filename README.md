# aquaculture_automation_using_lora

This is our MUP (Minimum Usable Prototype), which was built for a course called ProtoSem which happened at FORGE.FACTORY

This project was tried to Automate an Aquaculture farm. Thorough this we can get the values of pH, Temperature, TDS and Alkalinity. And send the data to The Things Network through LoRaWAN Communication Protocol.

The components required to make this are:
1) Arduino UNO / Mega2560
2) RAK811 Wisnode LoRa Module
3) pH Sensor (dfRobot)
4) Temperature Sensor (DS18B20)
5) TDS Sensor (dfRobot)
